## What it does

Generates a complete dashboard page into your `ccai-website-builder-setup` Next.js project:
- Stat cards for top-line numbers
- Data tables for lists (with search + filter)
- Charts for trends
- Mock data baked in so the dashboard renders immediately
- Typed interfaces in `lib/data/` ready for you to wire to real sources

Three layout options:
- **A: Stat cards + table + chart** (most common)
- **B: Sidebar nav + multi-section** (complex dashboards)
- **C: Single-table focus** (when there's one main list)

## Why mock data first

The biggest dashboard-building mistake is wiring data first and looking at design second. The skill generates with mock data so:
1. You see the dashboard render in ~5 minutes
2. You can iterate the layout before sinking 60-90 min into API wiring
3. The wiring step is bounded, you know exactly what data shape each function returns

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/creativecore-ai/ccai-dashboard-builder ~/.claude/skills/ccai-dashboard-builder
